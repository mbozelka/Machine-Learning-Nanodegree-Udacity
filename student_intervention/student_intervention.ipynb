    "    - Decision Trees have been successfully used to access credit risk of loan applications. Source: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr07/cos424/papers/mitchell-dectrees.pdf\n",
    "    - Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visually appealing. Decision Trees preform well when the features involve a few discrete outcomes allowing it to conform to an if/then type scenario. \n",
    "    - Decision Trees can be prone to over fitting when there are a lot of features being considered. Also as the trees grow in height they can become more complicated and slow. Therefore care is needed to ensure the trees are balanced.\n",
    "    - I believe this may be a good candidate for the problem because the features represent attributes that have a few possible outcomes that are disjointed, and the target value has a discrete outcome of yes or no.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2: Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machines have found good support in the real world in biometric applications, text recognition applications, as well as image recognition applications. Source: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/cs4701/documents/jason_svm_tutorial.pdf\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machines are a relatively advanced model that allows for a lot of fine-tuning in order to maximize the margin between classifications. It also supports kernels making it well suited for data that does not conform to some form of linear separation.\n",
    "    - One of the major weaknesses of a Support Vector Machine is that they may perform poorly with data that contains a lot of features. They can be overly slow in the testing and training phases.\n",
    "    - I believe this would be a good candidate for the given data because it handles classification very well, especially in instances where the data is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 3: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes has found a lot of success in text categorization as well as word recognition in the real world. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes are often highly scalable and work well with a lot of features. It performs well when the features are independent of each other and also represent discrete values.\n",
    "    - One weakness in the model is it does not take into consideration interactions between features. However, in practice this not always that big of a disadvantage as one might think, but it seems reasonable to conclude it will perform poorly when each of the features have a heavy reliance on each other or when the features are continuous.\n",
    "    - At first I did not consider this model to be appropriate, but after further thought I feel the data conforms to the strengths of Naive Bayes quite well. I have a feeling each feature will have a strong independence between each other allowing to take a more probabilistic approach to solving the problem. Essentially I think it is reasonable to think a student may be in trouble of not passing given the probability of certain features being present.\n"

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
